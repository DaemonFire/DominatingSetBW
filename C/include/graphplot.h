// This obsolete function was created in order to give some visual representation of the graph and the data we would be computing about the graph. But I've decided to use a pre-existing JAVA Canevas instead and thus, have not implemented much in here (though the plot of the graph is correct and can be used
int generatePlotFile (dectree t, graph g);
